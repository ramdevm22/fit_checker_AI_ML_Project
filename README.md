Overview

fitChecker is an AI-powered web application that predicts the best-fitting clothing size for a user based on their body measurements extracted from an image.
It also allows the user to upload a clothing image and checks how well that clothing would fit, giving a real-time Fit Score and summary such as “Perfect Fit”, “Good Fit”, or “Loose”.

The system uses:

MediaPipe Pose Estimation for body landmark detection

OpenCV for image processing

Flask as the backend API

React.js + Bootstrap for a modern responsive UI

⚙️ Features

✅ Upload a user image and enter height (in cm)
✅ Upload a cloth image for comparison
✅ Get real-time body measurements (chest, waist, hips)
✅ AI-generated fit score and summary
✅ Clean, responsive, and minimal Bootstrap interface
✅ Modular architecture (Frontend + Backend separation)

Fit Score Algorithm : 

The system calculates how closely the user’s body measurements match the cloth measurements.
FitScore=100×(1−2×Tolerance∣User−Cloth∣​)

erfect Fit: |User − Cloth| ≤ 2 cm

Good Fit: |User − Cloth| ≤ 5 cm

Acceptable Fit: |User − Cloth| ≤ 8 cm

Poor Fit: Otherwise

The average of chest, waist, and hip scores gives the final Fit Score.
AI Measurement Logic

Detects 33 body landmarks using MediaPipe Pose.

Calculates chest width (distance between shoulders).

Converts pixel distance → cm using user height.

Estimates:

Chest circumference = Shoulder width × π × correction factor

Waist ≈ 0.85 × Chest

Hip ≈ 1.05 × Chest

 User Interface Overview

 Step 1: Upload user image and enter height
 Step 2: Upload cloth image
 Step 3: Get real-time predicted measurements and fit score

Conclusion

The fitChecker project successfully demonstrates how AI and computer vision can enhance the online shopping experience.
By automating body-measurement estimation and clothing-fit evaluation, this system reduces guesswork, improves satisfaction, and lays the foundation for future AI-driven virtual try-on systems.
